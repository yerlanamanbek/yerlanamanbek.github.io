"Pedestrian wind comfort plays an essential role in the urban environment. In our work, we consider a model obtained using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) around a tall building. Our focus is the Tower of Qazaqstan 
or Abu Dhabi Plaza in Nur-Sultan city (Kazakhstan), which will be the tallest building in Central Asia with a height of 310.8 m. We investigated the effect of the wind velocity on pedestrians by solving the incompressible 
time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations in the deal.II library by the Finite Element Method (FEM) using the projection method. We present numerical simulation results for various scenarios. It has been found that the 
velocity profile can vary in the domain that creates different pedestrian comfort conditions including the exceeded category at places dedicated to pedestrian walking."
