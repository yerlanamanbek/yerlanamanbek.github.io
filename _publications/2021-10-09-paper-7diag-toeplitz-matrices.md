"This paper presents the explicit inverse of a class of seven-diagonal (near) Toeplitz matrices, whicharises in the numerical solutions of nonlinear fourth-order dierential equation with a nite dierencemethod. A non-recurrence explicit inverse formula is derived using the Sherman-Morrison formula. Relatedto the xed-point iteration used to solve the dierential equation, we show the positivity of the inverse matrixand construct an upper bound for the norms of the inverse matrix, which can be used to predict the conver-gence of the method."
