"CO2 storage is a greenhouse gas mitigation instrument for many countries.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility of CO2 storage in the region of the Precaspian basin using the compositional flow model that was verified by the data of the Frio pilot project, USA. 
We use local grid refinement in the commercial reservoir simulator. In the reservoir simulation for data of the Frio Pilot project,  we have achieved a good history matching of the well pressure. 
The different scenarios were tested and post-injection migration was shown for both case studies. The long-term reservoir simulation shows the potential amount of trapped CO2 by residual and 
dissolved trapping mechanisms in the Precaspian basin."
