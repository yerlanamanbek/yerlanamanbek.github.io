"In this study, three-dimensional simulations of cone penetration tests (CPT) in cemented sandstone have been investigated using the Discrete Element Method (DEM).
 We generated the realistic grain size distribution of sandstone in the numerical simulations using the Ustyurt-Buzachi Sedimentary Basin samples. Numbers of numerical
 CPT tests at different bond strength values were performed with the penetrometer vertically moved down at a constant rate. The results of the real-world particle size
 distribution show that the cone penetration resistance and side friction increase with increasing depths; and with increase in bond strength the cone resistance and 
 side friction decrease, while the friction ratio increases. The result of numerical CPT tests in cemented sandstone was found to be in good agreement with the
 Soil Behaviour Type (SBT) classification system from CPT data."
