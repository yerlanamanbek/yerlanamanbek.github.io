"This paper analyzes the inverse of near Toeplitz pentadiagonal matrices, arising from a finite-difference approximation to the fourth-order nonlinear beam equation. 
Explicit non-recursive inverse matrix formulas and bounds of norms of the inverse matrix are derived for the clamped–free and clamped–clamped boundary conditions. 
The bound of norms is then used to construct a convergence bound for the fixed-point iteration of the form  for solving the nonlinear equation. Numerical computations 
presented in this paper confirm the theoretical results."
