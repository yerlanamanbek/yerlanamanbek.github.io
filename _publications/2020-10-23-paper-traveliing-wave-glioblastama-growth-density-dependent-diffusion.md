"Mathematical modeling for cancerous disease has attracted increasing attention from the researchers around the world. Being an effective tool, it helps to describe the processes that happen to 
the tumour as the diverse treatment scenarios. In this paper, a density-dependent reaction-diffusion equation is applied to the most aggressive type of brain cancer, Glioblastoma multiforme. 
The model contains the terms responsible for the growth, migration and proliferation of the malignant tumour. The traveling wave solution used is justified by stability analysis. 
Numerical simulation of the model is provided and the results are compared with the experimental data obtained from the reference papers. "
