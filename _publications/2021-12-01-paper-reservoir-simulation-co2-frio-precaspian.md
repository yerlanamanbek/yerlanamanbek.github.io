"CO2 storage is a greenhouse gas mitigation instrument for many countries. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of CO2 storage in the region of the Precaspian basin using the 
compositional flow model that was verified by the data of the Frio pilot project, USA. We use local grid refinement in the commercial reservoir simulator. In the reservoir simulation 
for data of the Frio Pilot project, we have achieved a good history matching of well pressure. Different scenarios were tested, and post-injection migration was shown for both case 
studies. The long-term reservoir simulation shows the potential amount of trapped CO2 by residual and dissolved trapping mechanisms in the Precaspian basin. The performed uncertainty 
study covered the uncertainty of the model’s parameters resulting in P10, P50 and P90 cases in terms of the amount of trapped CO2."
