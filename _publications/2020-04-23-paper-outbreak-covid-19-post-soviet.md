"Governmental response was shown to be as an important determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic 
in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained to reduce active cases 
during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated possible scenarios based on the proposed model 
can potentially be used by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States 
as well as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic."
