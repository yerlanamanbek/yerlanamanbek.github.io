"Permeability prediction plays a critical role in many engineering applications that involve fluid flow 
through porous media. Various factors including pore shape, particle size, polydispersity and compaction levels 
can significantly impact the flow behavior of a porous medium. Moreover, the influence of cementation should also 
be considered. In this work, we investigate the effect of particle cementation on the permeability using the
 three-dimensional resolved CFD-DEM approach. The modified cohesive contact model is utilized to simulate the 
 cementation behavior of particles. The numerical model is initially validated by a laboratory experiment
 demonstrating similar results for the permeability of the sample with polydisperse particles. Results show that
 the permeability in both polydisperse and monodisperse particle systems decreases when the cementation of particles
 increases. Especially, this relationship is observed at higher porosity values. In contrast, in more compacted 
 samples with lower porosity, the cementation effect becomes less. The numerical study also shows that the tortuosity
 values in both particle systems increase almost linearly with decreasing porosity. However, the strong influence of
 cementation on tortuosity is noticeable only in a monodisperse particle system dominated by uniform pore shapes with 
 regular fluid paths. A study of fluid flow at different gradation levels reveals that an increase in cementation 
 leads to a significant decrease in the permeability in a sample with larger particles. From the point of view of 
 applying the numerical model to the real reservoir sand sample, the numerical results of permeability align well 
 with the data reported by many studies.
