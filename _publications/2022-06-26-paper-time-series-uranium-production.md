"The efficient estimation of the production rate in the uranium reservoir plays a vital role in the evaluation of operational performance. This paper presents 
the data-driven production model in the uranium field using LightGBM for the data from the Kazakhstan deposits. We focus on predicting the fault events of the 
well production solution. Numerical results of this investigation show that LightGBM achieves an accurate prediction with wavelet transformation. The evaluation
 of the model score is conducted by using metrics such as Recall and F1. With feature engineering by wavelet transformation, we obtained 
 the recall of 0.84 and f1 of 0.89. The LightGBM model with the Morlet wavelet transformation can be useful to solve the issue of prediction maintenance of production well."
