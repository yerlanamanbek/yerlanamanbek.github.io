This page provides regular updates of COVID-19 model outcomes for the Post-Soviet states. The model uses the SIERPQ (Susceptible-Protected-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered-Dead). 
For more details of result we refer the reader to the <strong> preprint </strong> [https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071704](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071704){:target="_blank"}.

Based on the model, the behavior of R0 is illustrated in below figure.
