This page provides regular updates of COVID-19 model outcomes for the Post-Soviet states. The dynamics simulation uses the SPEIQRD (Susceptible-Protected-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered-Dead) model. 
For more details of result we refer the reader to the <strong> preprint </strong> [https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071704](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071704){:target="_blank"}.

The basic reproduction number, R0, can be seen as the average number of people who are infected from an active case. Based on the model, the behavior of R0 is illustrated in the below figure.

According to the SPEIQRD model, R0 values are shown in the below table for May 1, 2020.


| Country 	| R0 	|
|:----------:	|:------:	|
| Armenia 	| 0.9253 	|
| Azerbaijan 	| 0.0023 	|
| Belarus 	| 4.9832 	|
| Georgia 	| 0.2326 	|
| Kazakhstan 	| 1.0215 	|
| Kyrgyzstan 	| 0.2014 	|
| Moldova 	| 0.0339 	|
| Russia 	| 0.8660 	|
| Uzbekistan 	| 0.0053 	|
