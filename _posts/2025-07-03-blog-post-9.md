I’m pleased to share that our recent research work was recognized with the Best Paper Award at the [International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2025)](https://iccsa.org/).

The awarded paper was led by Daulet Kalesh, a recent graduate of the NU Master’s program in Applied Mathematics. The work reflects collaborative efforts within our research team at Nazarbayev University, and I’m proud to see our contribution gaining international recognition.
