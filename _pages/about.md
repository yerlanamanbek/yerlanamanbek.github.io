I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CSEM) at 
the [Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"}  in the The University of Texas at Austin, 
where I am at the [Center for Subsurface Modeling](http://csm.ices.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} and I was supervised by [Professor Mary Wheeler](http://users.ices.utexas.edu/~mfw/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interest brings together interdisciplinary areas of mathematics, physics, engineering and
computational science. In particularly, my research focuses on the numerical analysis of partial differential
systems that arise in subsurface phenomena using mathematical modeling and scientific computation.
My main interests are finite element methods, numerical analysis including a priori and a posteriori error
analysis, scientific computing, computational transport phenomena and numerical reservoir simulations.
My Ph.D. work has given me an opportunity to study these problems theoretically and numerically by
taking into account experimental laboratory data work.

Research
=====
Subsurface reservoir flow and reactive transport modeling is important in many subsurface applications
such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), CO2 sequestration, groundwater remediation as well as contaminant
plume migration in heterogeneous porous media. As Doctoral candidate, I am working on these projects:
1. Developing a new adaptive numerical homogenization method to handle multiscale nature of flow and
	transport problems of heterogeneous subsurface
2. A priori analysis for slightly compressible flow using Enhanced Velocity Mixed Finite Element Method
	(EVMFEM).
3. A posteriori error analysis for slightly compressible flow problems using EVMFEM
4. Time domain decomposition methods for flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media problems
	
In addition, I was selected to attend Research Experience Carbon Sequestration program 2017
and this program gave me opportunity to explore the important stages of Carbon Capture, Utilization
and Storage (CCUS). Field trips including industrial and geological sites were valuable for better
understanding CCUS complexities as well as helped to expand my practical interpretation skills.
