* M.Sc. in  IT, [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore, 2009
* B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, [Al-Farabi Kazakh National University](http://kaznu.kz/en){:target="_blank"}, Kazakhstan, 2006

Research Interests
======
_Numerical modeling_: domain decomposition, discretization schemes, multiscale methods,
a posteriori and a priorri error analysis, robust and efficient solution algorithms.


Work experience
======
  * 2014-: Research Assistant Center for Subsurface Modeling, Institute for Computational Engineering
and Sciences(ICES)
    * Developed adaptive numerical homogenization method for 
ow and transport
model at reduced computational cost. Poster of this work was awarded in the
Texas Applied Math & Eng Symposium.
    * Derived and conducted a priori error analysis for slightly compressible 
ow
using EVMFEM in continuous and discrete time cases.
    * Time domain decomposition methods for 
ow and transport in heterogeneous
porous media problems. Poster was presented in SIAM Conference on Computational
Science and Engineering at Atlanta.
    * Developed a posteriori error estimate for EVMFEM. This is a great in practical
applications in adaptive mesh renement.
    * Presented research outcomes to industry professionals.
