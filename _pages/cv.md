Work experience
======
  * 2014-: Research Assistant Center for Subsurface Modeling, Institute for Computational Engineering
and Sciences(ICES)
    * Developed adaptive numerical homogenization method for 
ow and transport
model at reduced computational cost. Poster of this work was awarded in the
Texas Applied Math & Eng Symposium.
    * Derived and conducted a priori error analysis for slightly compressible 
ow
using EVMFEM in continuous and discrete time cases.
    * Time domain decomposition methods for 
ow and transport in heterogeneous
porous media problems. Poster was presented in SIAM Conference on Computational
Science and Engineering at Atlanta.
    * Developed a posteriori error estimate for EVMFEM. This is a great in practical
applications in adaptive mesh refinement.
    * Presented research outcomes to industry professionals.
  * Github University
  * Duties included: Tagging issues
  * Supervisor: Professor Git
