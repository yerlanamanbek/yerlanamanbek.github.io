My research interest brings together interdisciplinary areas of mathematics, physics, engineering and
computational science. In particularly, my research focuses on the numerical analysis of partial differential
systems that arise in subsurface phenomena using mathematical modeling and scientific computation.
My main interests are finite element methods, numerical analysis including a priori and a posteriori error
analysis, scientific computing, computational transport phenomena and numerical reservoir simulations.
My Ph.D. work has given me an opportunity to study these problems theoretically and numerically by
taking into account experimental laboratory data work.
